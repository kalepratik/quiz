# 🚀 Quick Deployment Guide

## ❌ **The Problem**

Your GitHub Pages site at [https://kalepratik.github.io/quiz/](https://kalepratik.github.io/quiz/) is showing the README file instead of the quiz application because:

- **GitHub Pages** only supports static websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Your application** is a Flask Python server that needs to run on a backend
- **GitHub Pages** cannot run Python/Flask applications

## ✅ **The Solution**

Deploy your Flask application to a platform that supports Python applications.
